These files give the frequency information for each possible allele, for each of the positions, in the deeply sequenced wildtype virus. The expectation here is that each allele should be the reference allele, and any deviations from this are the result of some sort of experimental error (i.e. sequencing error, pcr error, random mutations, etc.). There is one file for the Rev gene and one file for the Tat gene. These files are tab delimited. The first column contains both the position and reference allele (as a codon). These two pieces of information are separated by a single 'space' within this column. The following columns give the observed frequency for each of the possible alleles (note that which ever the reference allele is should have a freq that is close to 1). The final column gives the total read count (i.e. coverage) for this position. Note that the first line gives the identity of the alleles for each of the columns.
