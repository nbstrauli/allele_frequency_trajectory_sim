These data contain the allele frequency information that was obtained by deeply sequencing Tat and Rev (in duplicate) before and after the competition experiments. The 'tat' and 'rev' directories here correspond to the Tat and Rev genes, respectively. The files within these directories that end in 'pre_selection.txt' correspond to the frequency information for each of the alleles prior to the competition experiments. The files ending in 'post_selection_[1or2].txt' correspond to the frequency information for each of the alleles after the competitions experiments (1 or 2 distinguishing which biological replicate the data pertains to). 

The files are tab delimited. The 1st and last columns give the number of reads that mapped to that position (i.e. read depth, or coverage). The 2nd column contains both the position and reference allele (as a codon). These two pieces of information are separated by a single 'space' within this column. The following columns (up until the final column) give the observed frequency for each of the possible alleles.
